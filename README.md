# Tile-X: A Vertex Reordering Approach for Scalable Long Read Assembly

Tile-X is a graph-based approach for optimizing long-read genome assembly by reordering sequencing reads prior to assembly. By leveraging vertex reordering techniques, Tile-X enhances parallelism, reduces memory usage, and improves the contiguity of assembled genomes while maintaining high accuracy.
